An autonomous, multi-agent fleet health management system designed for proactive automotive maintenance. This version represents a significant evolution of the project, transitioning to **LangGraph** for more robust, stateful orchestration and improved agentic control.

> [!NOTE]
> This is the improved **LangGraph** implementation of the system. For the previous **CrewAI** version, please visit: [Automotive-Predictive-Maintenance-AI-System_CREWAI](https://github.com/aarush323/Automotive-Predictive-Maintenance-AI-System_CREWAI)

## 🚀 Evolution & Key Improvements

This implementation brings several architectural enhancements over the original CrewAI version:
- **Stateful Orchestration**: Powered by LangGraph's state management, allowing for reliable recovery and complex cyclical workflows.
- **Unified Data Persistence**: Real-time synchronization between agent outputs and a centralized SQLite database.
- **Improved Diagnostic Reasoning**: Enhanced agent logic for Z-Score anomaly detection and cross-fleet pattern recognition.
- **Live Thought Trace**: Real-time SSE log streaming that provides direct visibility into the AI agents' reasoning process during active runs.

## 🛠 Features

### 🤖 Autonomous AI Orchestration
- **LangGraph Multi-Agent System**: A sophisticated DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) of AI agents that process vehicle data, perform diagnostic reasoning, and initiate remedial actions.
- **Hybrid LLM Strategy**: Utilizes specialized models for different tasks (e.g., **Phi-3** for data analysis, **GPT-class models** for complex diagnostics).

### 📈 Predictive Intelligence
- **Cross-Fleet RCA (Root Cause Analysis)**: Detects manufacturing-level failure patterns across the entire fleet to identify systemic defects.
- **Automated Risk Scoring**: Real-time calculation of vehicle health scores based on anomalous sensor telemetry and historical failure trends.

### 🔌 Real-Time Visibility
- **Live Execution Console**: A specialized log stream that provides "Developer-in-the-Loop" visibility into the AI's thread of thought.
- **Glassmorphic Dashboard**: A premium UI featuring real-time health trends, failure distribution analytics, and interactive maps.

## 🏗 Tech Stack

### Backend & AI
- **Python 3.12**: Core logic and data processing.
- **FastAPI**: High-performance REST API and SSE log streaming.
- **LangGraph**: Sophisticated agent state management and orchestration.
- **SQLite**: Local persistence for historical run data, failure logs, and appointments.

### Frontend
- **React 18 + Vite**: Lightning-fast UI and modern developer experience.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with a custom modern design system.
- **Framer Motion**: Smooth, high-fidelity micro-animations and transitions.
- **Lucide React**: Modern iconography.

## 🏗 System Architecture

The system is split into two core layers:
1.  **Orchestration Layer (LangGraph)**: Manages specialized nodes for Data Analysis, AI Diagnosis, Engagement, Scheduling, and Manufacturing RCA.
2.  **Infrastructure Layer (FastAPI & SQLite)**: Manages a unified `get_db()` singleton pattern to ensure data consistency across the parallel agent runs.
